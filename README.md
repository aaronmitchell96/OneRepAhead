project description: ***

For my bootcamp capstone project, I will create a fitness themed website. I will create my own backend API, containing information about various workouts. My front end will display information about these workouts in a neat, and stylish way. In addition to assisting the everyday gym member, my website will help independent trainers find clients, clients find trainers, members connect with other members to find their next gym partner, users can put together their own workout, and more features listed below. 

Features desired in my website:
Login/Logout: Users have the ability to login and see personalized information directed towards them
User profile page  profile picture, PR’s?, pictures/videos, location, bio, etc…?
	- create your own workout feature which allows you to drag and drop workouts categorized by muscle group (separate app?)
*Workouts can be categorized by the following:
(muscle group, difficulty level, *most popular(most favorited by end users), cardiovascular vs strength, etc??) 

API route ideas:
https://www.onerepaheadtraining.com/api/workouts/{muscle_group}  pulls all data stored in api for   that specific muscle group 
https://www.onerepaheadtraining.com/api/workouts/create_new -> Creates a new workout that only the end user can see. Information is pulled from a form.
